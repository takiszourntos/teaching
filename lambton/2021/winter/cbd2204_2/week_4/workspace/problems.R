# create a dataframe out of tidyverse's mpg data

# create vectors to access various variables
x_displ <- datampg$displ
y_cty <- datampg$cty
z_year <- datampg$year

# question 1: what are the mean, median and first & third quartiles for 
# each of these variables?

# question 2: are displacement and fuel economy correlated? Please
# provide a quantitative answer

# question 3: are engines getting smaller each year? How can you show
# the relationship between engine size and model year?

# question 4: is manual transmission more fuel efficient than automatic 
# transmission?

# question 5: which manufacturer makes the most fuel efficient cars?
