The goal of the  **climate** R package is to automatize downloading of meteorological
and hydrological data from publicly available repositories:

- OGIMET [(ogimet.com)](http://ogimet.com/index.phtml.en) 
- University of Wyoming - atmospheric vertical profiling data (http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/).
- Polish Institute of Meterology and Water Management - National Research Institute [(IMGW-PIB)](https://dane.imgw.pl/)
- National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration - Earth System Research Laboratory - Global Monitoring Division [(NOAA)](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/)
- National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration - National Climatic Data Center - Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) [(NOAA)](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/)

## Functions 

The **climate** package consists of ten main functions - three for meteorological data, one for hydrological data and six auxiliary functions and datasets:
  
### Meteorological data
  
- **meteo_ogimet()** - Downloading hourly and daily meteorological data from the SYNOP stations available in the ogimet.com collection.
Any meteorological (aka SYNOP) station working under the World Meteorological Organizaton framework after year 2000 should be accessible.

- **meteo_imgw()** - Downloading hourly, daily, and monthly meteorological data from the SYNOP/CLIMATE/PRECIP stations available in the dane.imgw.pl collection. 
It is a wrapper for `meteo_monthly()`, `meteo_daily()`, and `meteo_hourly()` from [the **imgw** package](https://github.com/bczernecki/imgw).

- **meteo_noaa_hourly()** - Downloading hourly NOAA Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) meteorological data - Some stations have > 100 years long history of observations


- **sounding_wyoming()** - Downloading measurements of the vertical profile of atmosphere (aka rawinsonde data)

### Hydrological data

- **hydro_imgw()** - Downloading hourly, daily, and monthly hydrological data from the SYNOP / CLIMATE / PRECIP stations available in the
danepubliczne.imgw.pl collection.
It is a wrapper for `hydro_annual()`, `hydro_monthly()`, and `hydro_daily()` from [the **imgw** package](https://github.com/bczernecki/imgw).

### Auxiliary functions and datasets

- **stations_ogimet()** - Downloading information about all stations available in the selected
country in the Ogimet repository
- **nearest_stations_ogimet()** - Downloading information about nearest stations to the selected point
available for the selected country in the Ogimet repository
- **imgw_meteo_stations** - Built-in   metadata from the IMGW-PIB repository for   meteorological   stations,   their   geographical
coordinates, and ID numbers
- **imgw_hydro_stations** - Built-in metadata from the IMGW-PIB repository for   hydrological   stations,    their   geographical
coordinates, and ID numbers
- **imgw_meteo_abbrev** - Dictionary explaining variables available for meteorological stations (from the IMGW-PIB repository)
- **imgw_hydro_abbrev** - Dictionary explaining variables available for hydrological stations (from the IMGW-PIB repository)

## Examples

Examples shows aplication of climate package with additional use of tools that help with processing the data to increase legible of downloaded data.  

- [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)
- [tidyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyr)

### Example 1

Finding a 50 nearest meteorological stations in a given country:

``` {r stations , eval=T, fig.width=7,fig.height=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
library(climate)
ns = nearest_stations_ogimet(country ="United+Kingdom",
                             point = c(-4, 56),
                             no_of_stations = 50, 
                             add_map = TRUE)
head(ns)
#>    wmo_id       station_names       lon       lat alt  distance [km]
#> 29  03144         Strathallan  -3.733348 56.31667  35      46.44794
#> 32  03155           Drumalbin  -3.733348 55.61668 245      52.38975
#> 30  03148           Glen Ogle  -4.316673 56.41667 564      58.71862
#> 27  03134   Glasgow Bishopton  -4.533344 55.90002  59      60.88179
#> 35  03166 Edinburgh Gogarbank  -3.350007 55.93335  57      73.30942
#> 28  03136      Prestwick RNAS  -4.583345 55.51668  26      84.99537
```

### Example 2

Summary of stations available in Ogimet repository for a selected country:

``` {r stations, eval=T, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.fullwidth=T}
library(climate)
PL = stations_ogimet(country ="Poland", add_map = TRUE)
head(PL)
```

### Example 3
Downlading hourly meteorological data Svalbard in a random year from Ogimet
  
``` {r windrose,eval=T}
# downloading data with NOAA service:
df = meteo_noaa_hourly(station = "010080-99999", 
                       year = sample(2000:2020, 1))

# downloading the same data with Ogimet.com (example for 2019):
# df <- meteo_ogimet(interval = "hourly", date = c("2019-01-01", "2019-12-31"),
#                   station = c("01008"))
```

```{r windrose2, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(df[,c(-2:-5)],10), caption = "Examplary data frame of meteorological data.")
```

### Example 4
Downloading atmospheric (sounding) profile for Łeba, PL rawinsonde  station:

```{r sonda,eval=T, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
library(climate)
data("profile_demo")
# same as:
# profile_demo <- sounding_wyoming(wmo_id = 12120,
#                                  yy = 2000,
#                                  mm = 3,
#                                  dd = 23,
#                                  hh = 0)
df2 <- profile_demo[[1]] 
colnames(df2)[c(1, 3:4)] = c("PRESS", "TEMP", "DEWPT") # changing column names
```


```{r sonda2, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(df2,10), caption = "Examplary data frame of sounding preprocessing")
```

### Example 5
Preparing an annual summary of air temperature and precipitation, processing with **dplyr** 

```{r imgw_meteo, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
library(climate)
library(dplyr)

df = meteo_imgw(interval = 'monthly', rank='synop', year = 1991:2019, station = "ŁEBA") 
# please note that sometimes 2 names are used for the same station in different years

df2 = select(df, station:t2m_mean_mon, rr_monthly)

monthly_summary = df2 %>% 
  group_by(mm) %>% 
  summarise(tmax = mean(tmax_abs, na.rm = TRUE), 
            tmin = mean(tmin_abs, na.rm = TRUE),
            tavg = mean(t2m_mean_mon, na.rm = TRUE), 
            precip = sum(rr_monthly) / n_distinct(yy))            

monthly_summary = as.data.frame(t(monthly_summary[, c(5,2,3,4)])) 
monthly_summary = round(monthly_summary, 1)
colnames(monthly_summary) = month.abb

```

```{r imgw_meto2, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(monthly_summary), caption = "Examplary data frame of meteorological preprocessing.")
```

### Example 6
Calculate the mean maximum value of the flow on the stations in each year with **dplyr**'s `summarise()`, and spread data by year using **tidyr**'s `spread()` to get the annual means of maximum flow in the consecutive columns.

```{r data}
library(climate)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
h = hydro_imgw(interval = "monthly", year = 2001:2005, coords = TRUE)
head(h)
```


```{r filtering, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
h2 = h %>%
  filter(idex == 3) %>%
  select(id, station, X, Y, hyy, Q) %>%
  group_by(hyy, id, station, X, Y) %>%
  summarise(annual_mean_Q = round(mean(Q, na.rm = TRUE), 1)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = hyy, values_from = annual_mean_Q)
```

```{r filtering2, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(h2), caption = "Examplary data frame of hydrological preprocesssing.")
```
