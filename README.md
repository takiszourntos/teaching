## TOOLKIT FOR EMBEDDED SYSTEMS
==============================================

The following is a comprehensive list with links for recommended software and hardware tools needed for all terms in the program.

1) Ubuntu LTS for Desktops (https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) <br>
    Please do not run Linux under Windows using a Virtual Machine. This is too slow for our purposes, and, more importantly, does not help students get into a command-line  mindset. It is recommended that you use Linux exclusively while a student, and get yourself comfortable using the command line. In any case, Ubuntu is full-featured enough that you will not miss Windows much!
    
2) Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) <br>
    Please install under Linux!
    
3) Git <br>
    Install at the Linux prompt using the command: <br>
        $ sudo apt install git <br>
    Please obtain a github.com account and create respositories for your assignments and projects corresponding to each class you are taking.
    
4) BeagleBone Black Kit <br>
